# Ebunoluwa Arimoro | Architecting Certainty

A high-performance personal portfolio and ecosystem showcase built with **Next.js 15**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Framer Motion**. This site serves as the digital home for my work in engineering leadership, operational infrastructure, and venture building across the African landscape.

## 🚀 The Vision

This project is designed with a "Reliability as UX" philosophy. It moves beyond simple aesthetic to focus on system integrity, high-contrast visibility, and hardware-accelerated performance.

### Key Features:

- **Dynamic Ecosystem Navigation:** A context-aware footer that adapts based on the user's location within the site.
- **Hardware-Accelerated Smooth Scroll:** Optimized with GPU-layering for fluid transitions.
- **Mobile-First Architecture:** Custom stacked-to-grid layouts ensuring accessibility on all devices.
- **Brand Consistency:** High-integrity typography and "Sand & Charcoal" color palette.
